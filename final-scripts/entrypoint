        This is the Nextstrain pathogen build container.  It has a complete
        Nextstrain environment installed which is normally accessed via the
        \`nextstrain\` command on your computer (not in the container).
        
        If you're seeing this message though, you're probably not using the
        \`nextstrain\` command.  Welcome!  :-)
        
        The default container entrypoint will exec a command-line of your
        choosing in the build environment.  You can use this functionality to
        debug or develop Nextstrain pathogen builds and components.  Refer to
        the source of the \`nextstrain\` command for examples.
